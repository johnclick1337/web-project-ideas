# Web Project Ideas & Prototypes

This repository serves as a sandbox for exploring various web development concepts, UI/UX designs, and small functional prototypes. My focus is on learning modern HTML5, CSS3, and foundational JavaScript.

## Current Ideas:
- **Interactive Landing Page:** A responsive single-page layout with basic animations.
- **Simple To-Do App:** A basic JavaScript-driven application to manage tasks in the browser.
- **Personal Portfolio Mockup:** A template for a developer's portfolio.

## Technologies Explored:
- HTML5 (Semantic Structure)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Responsiveness)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, Event Handling)

Feel free to browse or suggest new ideas!
